## Custom App Audit
In this App audit, I’ll take a fresh professional look at your web app, determine critical flaws, and put together an actionable plan for improving your your performance and hosting costs. You’ll get a fancy (and incredibly useful) PDF report with a detailed teardown of your web app.
