## Custom App Audit
In this App audit, I’ll take a fresh professional look at your web app, determine critical flaws, and put together an actionable plan for improving your your performance and hosting costs. You’ll get a fancy (and incredibly useful) PDF report with a detailed teardown of your web app.

Audit packages start at $2,100. [Learn more](/app-audit)

## Custom App Building
For larger projects, we get together for a few days (typically 2-5) and design your application screen-by-screen. The process includes wireframes (when necessary) and a high-level tech plan. Please get in touch to get an estimate and to see if we’re a good fit.

My daily rate is currently $800. [Contact me](/contact) to get started

Packages start at $7,000/month (depending on the team size). [Contact me](/contact) for details
