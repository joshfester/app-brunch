# Custom UI Audit — the Actionable Screen-by-Screen Teardown of Your Web App
_Are your hosting costs eating all your profit? Let’s make your app's performance a competitive advantage, not an afterthought. In this audit, I’ll take a fresh professional look at your web app, determine critical performance flaws, and put together an actionable plan for improving efficiency._

## Are you experiencing any of these performance-related problems in your tech business?
- Users complain about your app loading too slowly.
- Host costs way more you would like.
- You hate wasting your time trying to understand the costs of your web app.
- Customers keep complaining about your app being unresponsive.
- You keep adding new features as requested by users, but that makes your app even slower, and your hosting costs push you further and further away from that simple and profitable product you dream to have.

You pay the bills, but deep down you know that this needs to stop. You deserve lower costs. Users deserve better performance. Will they churn because it's too slow?

Excellent performance is a competitive advantage. Bad, thoughtless performance is a bottleneck in your business. But where exactly is the problem? How do you find it? There’s not enough time in your day to read all the books and articles you need to get up to speed on it.

Here’s a helpful hint from one entrepreneur to another. Your own opinion is biased: you can’t fairly judge your own product.

## Your product needs a fresh professional eye

As a Rails/Wordpress consultant, I’ve been helping tech businesses for years. Recently I developed The App Audit method by collecting and systematizing common tech problems in web applications (now writing a book on it).

This “Done for You” version is your unique chance to hire me directly to audit your tech product. Here’s what I’ll do:
- define your product strategy and make sure your UI/UX aligns with it and reinforces key customer tasks;
- identify critical usability flaws in your web application;
- look for small wins that can instantly improve user experience;
- provide guidance for visual style, color and typography.

## “The audit was hugely helpful”

_“I LOVE IT! Our app has had many hands working on it. I was not satisfied with where we were — which is why I took up this audit offer. The team didn't have the experience to balance “release to users” vs “product performance.” The audit was hugely helpful, and we’ll also use it as a guide to handle new features.”_  
— Cliff Hancock, City Link TV

## You should consider using this service if…
- You run a tech company or startup.
- You have a solid product but you think it can perform much better.
- You expect a lot of growth, but don’t know how your app will handle it.
- Your app is “bloated” because you’ve been adding features for too long.
- You prefer to be informed about your hosting costs, rather than blindly throw money at it.
- You appreciate objective, well-reasoned feedback on your product.

## “It is such a relief to find a subject matter expert whom I can trust…”

_“Josh is a consummate professional when it comes to all aspects of development. It is such a relief to find a subject matter expert whom I can trust to give me the best possible advice and guidance when dealing with even the most complex web apps.”_  
— Luc Berlin, Miigle

## What are the deliverables?

The ultimate deliverable is **a comprehensive, actionable teardown of your web application** presented as a PDF report. First, I thoroughly inspect your web app and mark key points. Then I run an audit following my own method: we define your tech strategy and run a performance checklist for the key points of your web app.

I also make an epic number of comments along the way. These comments may include, but are not limited to:
- thoughts on your product/tech fit (how your tech stack can fit your value proposition in the best way);
- recommendations for keeping your web app simple and focused;
- optimization ideas to improve load times;
- performance suggestions;
- exclamations of respect and approval;
- small easy-to-fix notes;
- professional opinions;
- other relevant thoughts how to make your tech business shine.

## Will I review all aspects of your web app?

As you know, web apps come in all shapes and sizes. I’m not familiar with yours yet, so I can’t say. If you have a huge number of features, I won’t cover all of them, just 5–7 key points that provide the most important performance gains.

But what are these key points? I determine that myself, but usually it’s rather obvious where we should focus. Just following common sense here!

## Do I provide code or fixes?

In the basic package, there’s no actual "development work” happening. I’m giving you a punch list of high value performance improvements which you can check off as you have time. These recommendations will guide your decisions and help to avoid expensive mistakes.

The premium package, however, includes some hands-on development work, where I implement the recommendations in practice. It can be code or  , depending on your needs.

## Can you audit a website (mobile app, booklet, printable form, etc)?
No, The UI Audit is for web apps only. I could certainly audit anything you like — but this is a focused consulting offering that uses a specific method, targeted at web applications.

## I don’t have much time. What’s my level of involvement?
Here’s what you do (not too much):

- Tell me about your business and walk me through your web app at the initial consultation. Please come prepared with “a founder mindset” (or invite your co-founders/CEO), and be ready to share your screen via Skype.
- Provide login credentials for a trial/staging account.
- Stay in touch during the process, in case any questions arise.
- Review the audit results and ask clarifying questions. I’ll be happy to answer them and update the final version of the report.

## How much does the UI audit cost? How long will it take?

The Basic Package currently costs $1,795. You’ll receive an actionable audit report described above (15-20 pages).

The Premium Package costs $3,495 and includes actual design work (redesign of key screens and a complimentary style guide). This is what most clients request after conducting their audits. Not sure about this yet? You’re welcome to upgrade any time.

If you order right now, you’ll get your audit report within 2 weeks after our initial consultation. That’s way faster and more effective than waiting for a high-touch consulting opportunity.

The previous audits have collected amazing feedback. That’s why I provide a full 100% money-back guarantee on this offering. If you’re not happy with the audit results — I’ll give you a full refund, no questions asked.

## I’m interested! How do we get started?

Please [contact me](/contact) briefly describing your business and your top UI/UX problems. If you’re a good fit for the audit, I’ll send you a scheduling link for the initial consultation.
